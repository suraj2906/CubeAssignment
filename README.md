# Customer Details App

This is a React-based customer management application designed to display a list of 1000 customers, their details as selected, and a photo-grid of 9 photos, updating every 10 seconds. The application is built with lazy loading, initially rendering only 20 customers and loading more as you scroll down.

## Features

- **Lazy Loading:** The customer list is rendered incrementally as the user scrolls, optimizing performance for large datasets.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.
- **Random Photo Grid:** Each customer detail page displays a grid of random photos, refreshed every 10 seconds.
- **Selectable Customers:** Customers can be selected from the list to view detailed information.
